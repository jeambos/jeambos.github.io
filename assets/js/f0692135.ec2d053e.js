For example, when the hormonal cocktail begins to wear off, a person who doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening may become convinced that the relationship is no longer interesting and was probably a mistake from the start. They may start casting around for a new relationship, which they pursue with zeal until that NRE too wears off. In monogamous culture, this takes the form of short-term serial relationships. In nonmonogamy, this pattern can present as a series of ongoing relationships that begin explosively and then wither from neglect. The person keeps pursuing the next new hit of the body\u2019s endogenous high, very much like they might experience addiction to an external substance. To avoid this problem, you need a good dose of self-awareness and discernment: Is this the chemicals talking? How will you know? What are your checks and balances\u2014do you have a wise friend or two, a therapist, a less NRE-ful partner (or several), or other sources to help you stay grounded? How can you make sure your choices and actions best align with your values and fit with your ethical system?

But because nonmonogamy doesn\u2019t necessarily include expectations that partners will live together, and because it doesn\u2019t restrict sex and intimacy to one person, long-distance nonmonogamous relationships are more feasible. Another reason you see so many LDRs is that many nonmonogamous folks meet online or at conferences and gatherings that bring people together from far and wide. Plus, because nonmonogamous people represent a relatively small portion of the population, the selection of local nonmonogamous partners can be limited."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\u5355\u5076\u5236\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5f88\u96be\u9002\u5e94\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f53\u4f34\u4fa3\u8fdc\u5728\u5929\u8fb9\u65f6\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u957f\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u3002\u4f46\u56e0\u4e3a\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5305\u542b\u4f34\u4fa3\u5c06\u4f4f\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e0d\u5c06\u6027\u548c\u4eb2\u5bc6\u5173\u7cfb\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5f02\u5730\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u5173\u7cfb\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u4f60\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a LDR \u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u56e0\u662f\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u8005\u5728\u7f51\u4e0a\u6216\u5728\u6c47\u805a\u56db\u9762\u516b\u65b9\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u548c\u805a\u4f1a\u4e0a\u76f8\u9047\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u8005\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u4e2d\u5360\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u3002"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"LDRs exist in a constrained space.

Our society has long idealized nuclear families, but there are all kinds of families, including plenty of children who grow up without \u201ctraditional\u201d nuclear families. A lifelong, live-in romantic dyad is not the only healthy or acceptable way to raise children, and in fact the isolated nuclear family is a historically recent aberration. The expression \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d isn\u2019t (always) a metaphor. It\u2019s an accurate reflection of how many Indigenous cultures across the world have approached child-rearing for millennia, and have an expansive and communal mentality about what counts as a family. Plenty of cultures today value multigenerational living arrangements, with three and even four generations under the same roof or on the same street. If you were raised to believe the nuclear family is the only kind that counts, it\u2019s worth seeking out and learning about these other models, which are by no means extinct. As a nonmonogamous person, you might end up creating a beautiful live-in quad or triad with dedicated co-parents, not unlike the way your great-grandparents grew up, surrounded by aunts and uncles. Or you might lose your romantic relationship with your co-parent and end up as a single parent, or in a platonic co-parenting arrangement with your former partner, or in something that resembles a monogamous blended family (separated parents living with stepparents)."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u5b69\u5b50\u6216\u8ba1\u5212\u8981\u5b69\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f60\u60f3\u6210\u4e3a\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u8005\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u82b1\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u53bb\u89e3\u6784\u4f60\u5173\u4e8e\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u597d\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u5bb6\u5ead\u7406\u60f3\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bb8\u591a\u6ca1\u6709\u201c\u4f20\u7edf\u201d\u6838\u5fc3\u5bb6\u5ead\u957f\u5927\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u3002\u7ec8\u8eab\u7684\u3001\u540c\u5c45\u7684\u6d6a\u6f2b\u4e8c\u4eba\u7ec4\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u629a\u517b\u5b69\u5b50\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u5065\u5eb7\u6216\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5bb6\u5ead\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u662f\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u53cd\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u201c\u517b\u80b2\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b69\u5b50\u9700\u8981\u6574\u4e2a\u6751\u5e84\u201d\u8fd9\u53e5\u8bdd\u5e76\u4e0d\uff08\u603b\u662f\uff09\u662f\u4e2a\u6bd4\u55bb\u3002\u5b83\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u8bb8\u591a\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u6587\u5316\u6570\u5343\u5e74\u6765\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u80b2\u513f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4ec0\u4e48\u7b97\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5ead\u6709\u7740\u5e7f\u9614\u548c\u516c\u793e\u7684\u5fc3\u6001\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u6587\u5316\u91cd\u89c6\u591a\u4ee3\u540c\u5802\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u5b89\u6392\uff0c\u4e09\u4ee3\u751a\u81f3\u56db\u4ee3\u4eba\u4f4f\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c4b\u6a90\u4e0b\u6216\u540c\u4e00\u6761\u8857\u4e0a\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u4ece\u5c0f\u5c31\u88ab\u6559\u5bfc\u6838\u5fc3\u5bb6\u5ead\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u7b97\u6570\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5bfb\u627e\u5e76\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7edd\u672a\u706d\u7edd\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u7684\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u8005\uff0c\u4f60\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u540c\u5c45\u56db\u4eba\u7ec4\u6216\u4e09\u4eba\u7ec4\uff0c\u6709\u5c3d\u804c\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7236\u6bcd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f60\u66fe\u7956\u7236\u6bcd\u957f\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5468\u56f4\u90fd\u662f\u963f\u59e8\u548c\u53d4\u53d4\u3002\u6216\u8005\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5931\u53bb\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u6d6a\u6f2b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u4e3a\u5355\u4eb2\u7236\u6bcd\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4e0e\u524d\u4f34\u4fa3\u5904\u4e8e\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u7684\u5171\u540c\u80b2\u513f\u5b89\u6392\u4e2d\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5904\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u91cd\u7ec4\u5bb6\u5ead\uff08\u5206\u5c45\u7236\u6bcd\u4e0e\u7ee7\u7236\u6bcd\u540c\u4f4f\uff09\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u3002"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Parental shaming is rampant in North American culture, and as you might imagine, nonmonogamous parents are frequently targets of this shame.

For example, in Canada, it\u2019s not legal to have any kind of marriage ceremony with more than one person (unless you divorce one of them first). This comes from the country\u2019s anti-polygamy laws, which were upheld in a British Columbia Supreme Court ruling in 2011 in the context of an intensive investigation into an isolated Mormon polygamous sect operating in the town of Bountiful. The case was focused on religiously motivated coercive practices involving men with multiple wives, including child marriage, and advocates pointed out (accurately) that women were treated unequally and abuse abounded. All true, and terrible; and sadly, Bountiful is just one of many polygamous sects in North America with similar problems.
