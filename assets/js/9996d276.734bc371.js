It sounds clich\xe9, but it really is about cultivating a loving relationship with yourself\u2014learning to offer yourself the love and acceptance you never received from others. A trusted therapist can offer you mirroring and acceptance within a safe container, and with time, you can practise sharing more of yourself with trusted friends. We also know some folks for whom working with psychedelics such as psilocybin and ayahuasca has been transformative for healing their relationships with themselves. As this process goes on, you may also begin to feel guilt, regret or shame for how you have talked to or treated yourself in the past, and then it\u2019s important to practise love and compassion for the past self who was mean to you as well as the past self who you were being mean to.

Opportunity creates infidelity, or so you\u2019re told, so you limit opportunity. This approach is a lot more common in heterosexual relationships with rules against the amount of closeness permitted with members of one binary gender or another; it\u2019s a lot harder to do this in queer communities where groups don\u2019t always split easily down gender lines and people\u2019s friend circles are often also their dating pools. But even in queer monogamous relationships, sometimes partners limit each others\u2019 friendships and social lives by this same logic. In nonmonogamous relationships, this trope can manifest in more subtle ways, such as by trying to limit the depth of a connection or the time a partner spends with another partner. As we discuss in chapter 11, it\u2019s common for people in a relationship to seek to use their power to constrict, limit or regulate a partner\u2019s other relationships, in the hopes that this will make those other relationships less disruptive or threatening. People try all kinds of structures to do this: enforced power hierarchies, limitations on how much emotional or sexual intimacy a partner may experience with others, rules that an established couple will only have sex with a third person if both are there for it (often on the assumption that this will prevent jealousy), and so on."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"\u5355\u5076\u5e38\u6001\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u4fee\u8f9e\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u4f60\u7684\u4f34\u4fa3\u63a5\u89e6\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u4f34\u4fa3\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u4e0d\u5fe0\u3002\u673a\u4f1a\u521b\u9020\u4e0d\u5fe0\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f60\u662f\u8fd9\u4e48\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u8981\u9650\u5236\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6027\u604b\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0e\u67d0\u4e00\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u6210\u5458\u4eb2\u5bc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5728\u9177\u513f\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u96be\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u5bb9\u6613\u6309\u6027\u522b\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4eba\u4eec\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u5708\u901a\u5e38\u4e5f\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7ea6\u4f1a\u6c60\u3002\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9177\u513f\u5355\u5076\u5236\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4f34\u4fa3\u4e5f\u4f1a\u7528\u540c\u6837\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9650\u5236\u5f7c\u6b64\u7684\u53cb\u8c0a\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u751f\u6d3b\u3002\u5728\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fee\u8f9e\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8bd5\u56fe\u9650\u5236\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u4f34\u4fa3\u4e0e\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f34\u4fa3\u5171\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u7b2c 11 \u7ae0\u4e2d\u6240\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\uff0c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u8bd5\u56fe\u5229\u7528\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6743\u529b\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u9650\u5236\u6216\u89c4\u8303\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u80fd\u4f7f\u90a3\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u7cfb\u66f4\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u6216\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u4eba\u4eec\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5404\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff1a\u5f3a\u5236\u6743\u529b\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4f34\u4fa3\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eba\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u6027\u4eb2\u5bc6\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c4\u5b9a\u65e2\u5b9a\u592b\u5987\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u4e24\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u624d\u4f1a\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u53d1\u751f\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u4f1a\u9632\u6b62\u5ac9\u5992\uff09\uff0c\u7b49\u7b49\u3002"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Of course, not everyone will have such feelings.

Basically, you start by cultivating closer connections all around you, not just the ones that meet your definition of partnership.

When solitude is no longer something you dread, it takes that particular pressure off your relationship decisions, so you can reach out to your partners more authentically. It can help you access your capacity for compassion and generosity, and it leaves you more emotional and cognitive space to come up with creative solutions for getting your needs met and meeting others\u2019 needs.
