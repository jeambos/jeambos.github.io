Throughout history, different social contracts have prescribed, with more or less specificity, what reasonable expectations look like in a variety of relationships. These social contracts, though, are locally and culturally specific, and in today\u2019s diverse, globalized society, you\u2019re likely to end up forming a variety of relationships throughout your life with people who have been raised with at least some default expectations that differ from yours. Further, in nonmonogamy, you\u2019re intentionally rejecting large parts of the default social contract surrounding relationships that exists in most dominant societies today, so it can be really hard at the outset to know if you even have a mutual understanding with someone about what you\u2019re rejecting and what takes its place."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8c08\u8c08\u201c\u5408\u7406\u201d\u548c\u201c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u201d\u7684\u671f\u671b\u3002\n\u867d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u670b\u53cb\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5077\u4f60\u7684\u732b\u6216\u91cd\u529b\u5e94\u8be5\u8ba9\u4e1c\u897f\u6389\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u662f\u5e03\u6ee1\u5371\u9669\u6697\u7901\u7684\u6c34\u57df\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u51c6\u5907\u8ba9\u7c97\u5fc3\u5927\u610f\u7684\u4eba\u7ffb\u8239\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u671f\u671b\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u70b9\u6401\u6d45\u3002\u7eb5\u89c2\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5951\u7ea6\u6216\u591a\u6216\u5c11\u5177\u4f53\u5730\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u671f\u671b\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u5b50\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u793e\u4f1a\u5951\u7ea6\u5177\u6709\u5730\u57df\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5f53\u4eca\u591a\u5143\u5316\u3001\u5168\u7403\u5316\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4e00\u751f\u4e2d\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0e\u90a3\u4e9b\u6210\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9ed8\u8ba4\u671f\u671b\u4e0e\u4f60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u5efa\u7acb\u5404\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5355\u5076\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u6709\u610f\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\u5f53\u4eca\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u5bfc\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u56f4\u7ed5\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u793e\u4f1a\u5951\u7ea6\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u96be\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u67d0\u4eba\u5c31\u4f60\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ec0\u4e48\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u5b83\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["On the one hand, people do not, by and large, have the right to expect things of other people without their consent.
